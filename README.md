# minecraft

A new Flutter project.
Description: The pig is a passive mob found in the world of Minecraft. It is characterized by its pink coloration and snout. Pigs are commonly found roaming grassy or forested areas and are a valuable source of food for players. They can be bred using carrots, potatoes, or beetroots. When killed, pigs drop raw porkchops, which can be cooked for food.
